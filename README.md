# Learning Assistant App to Support Children with ADHD

As a collaborative team of six UX/UI Designers and Software Engineers, we were tasked with the question:
"What can you create to address accessibility challenges that exist within education technology?"

---

From our initial discussions, we identified that children with Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) are lacking support in the classroom. Gains in assistive technology could help to promote better learning for students who have ADHD, and help them find greater academic success.

Our app aims to provide children with ADHD ways to help them stay focused, gain confidence, and empower them to succeed academically.
